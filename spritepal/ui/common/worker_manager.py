"""
Worker Manager for consistent QThread worker lifecycle management.

This module provides simplified worker management that matches the patterns
used throughout the SpritePal codebase:
- Safe cleanup with cancel() and wait() (no dangerous terminate())
- Qt's built-in cancellation support via requestInterruption()
- Proper timeout handling with multiple attempts
- Consistent logging and error reporting

    Safe helper for managing QThread worker lifecycle.

    This class provides:
    - Safe worker cancellation patterns (no terminate())
    - Qt's built-in cancellation via requestInterruption()
    - Graceful shutdown with timeout handling
    - Debug logging for worker operations

    CRITICAL: Never uses QThread.terminate() which can corrupt Qt's internal state.
    Instead uses a multi-stage shutdown process:
    1. Call worker.cancel() if available (BaseWorker pattern)
    2. Use Qt's requestInterruption() mechanism
    3. Call quit() and wait() for clean shutdown
    4. Log warnings for unresponsive workers
