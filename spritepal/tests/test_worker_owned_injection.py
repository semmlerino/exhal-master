"""
Tests for worker-owned injection pattern (Phase 2 architecture).

These tests verify that the new manager-per-worker pattern provides:
- Perfect thread isolation for injection operations
- Excellent testability without mocking
- No shared state between tests
- Proper Qt object lifecycle management
