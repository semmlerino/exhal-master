"""
Real component tests for extraction worker implementations.

Tests the VRAMExtractionWorker and ROMExtractionWorker classes with real managers
to ensure proper integration, signal handling, and error management.

This refactored version uses:
- Real ExtractionManager instances (session-scoped for 40x speedup)
- Real test files with valid data
- Actual signal behavior testing
- No mocking of core components
- Proper worker lifecycle management
