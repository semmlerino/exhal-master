"""
Comprehensive stability test suite for Phase 1 fixes.

This test suite validates all critical stability improvements implemented in Phase 1:

1. WorkerManager Safe Cancellation:
   - Verifies workers can be cancelled safely without terminate()
   - Tests requestInterruption() mechanism
   - Validates timeout handling and graceful shutdown

2. Circular Reference Fixes:
   - Tests weak reference patterns work correctly
   - Verifies dialogs can be garbage collected
   - Ensures no memory leaks with repeated operations

3. TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) Race Condition Fixes:
   - Tests manager validity during concurrent operations
   - Verifies mutex protection under concurrent access
   - Ensures no deadlocks in manager initialization

4. QTimer Parent Relationship Fixes:
   - Tests timer cleanup when dialogs close
   - Verifies proper parent relationships prevent crashes
   - Tests rapid dialog open/close scenarios

Each test is designed to catch regressions and ensure the stability fixes
remain effective under various stress conditions.
