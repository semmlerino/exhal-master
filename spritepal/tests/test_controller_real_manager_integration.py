"""
Real Controller-Manager Integration Tests - Replacement for manager mocks.

This test file demonstrates the evolution from heavily mocked manager tests to real
manager-controller integration tests, showing how real implementations catch
cross-manager coordination bugs that mocks hide.

CRITICAL DIFFERENCES FROM MOCKED VERSION:
1. REAL manager instances with proper Qt lifecycle
2. REAL cross-manager signal propagation and coordination
3. REAL manager state synchronization testing
4. REAL controller-manager-UI integration chains
5. REAL error propagation across manager boundaries

This replaces heavy mock usage in test_controller.py:
- 7+ get_extraction_manager() mocks (patches manager access)
- 200+ lines of mock fixtures (MockSignal, create_mock_main_window)
- Mock manager method calls (hides real manager coordination)
- Fake signal chains (can't test real cross-manager communication)
