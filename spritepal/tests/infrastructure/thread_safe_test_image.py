Thread-Safe Test Image Implementation

This module provides ThreadSafeTestImage, a thread-safe alternative to QPixmap
for use in worker thread tests. It prevents Qt threading violations that cause
"Fatal Python error: Aborted" crashes.

Qt Threading Safety Rules:
- QPixmap: Main GUI thread ONLY (causes crashes in worker threads)
- QImage: Any thread (thread-safe for image processing)

This implementation follows Qt's canonical threading pattern for image operations.
