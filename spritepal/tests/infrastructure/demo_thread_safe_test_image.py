"""
Demonstration of ThreadSafeTestImage usage in threading scenarios.

This script shows the practical usage of ThreadSafeTestImage to prevent
Qt threading violations that cause "Fatal Python error: Aborted" crashes.

Run this script to see the difference between safe and unsafe Qt threading patterns.
