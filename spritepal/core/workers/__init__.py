"""
Worker thread architecture for SpritePal.

This module provides a standardized framework for async operations using QThread.
All workers inherit from common base classes to ensure consistent interfaces,
proper error handling, and type safety.

Base Classes:
- BaseWorker: Foundation for all worker threads
- ManagedWorker: Workers that delegate to managers
- ExtractionWorkerBase: Specialized for extraction operations
- InjectionWorkerBase: Specialized for injection operations
- ScanWorkerBase: Specialized for scanning operations
- PreviewWorkerBase: Specialized for preview generation operations

Architecture Patterns:
- Legacy: Workers use global singleton managers (for backward compatibility)
- Modern: Workers own their managers via factory pattern (recommended for new code)
