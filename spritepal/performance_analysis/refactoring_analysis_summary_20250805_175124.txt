RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. HAL compression shutdown is performing well (0.134s average). The refactoring successfully reduced shutdown complexity.

2. HAL shutdown process still has high cyclomatic complexity (180). Consider further refactoring to reduce complexity.

3. ROM extraction workflow still has high cyclomatic complexity (138). Consider further refactoring to reduce complexity.

4. Injection dialog validation still has high cyclomatic complexity (102). Consider further refactoring to reduce complexity.

5. Controller signal handling still has high cyclomatic complexity (95). Consider further refactoring to reduce complexity.
